Optimal Graduation Calculator for [Exponential Idle](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/) with calculations and data from [Phi*Tau Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lz_V0rCr3usm1Wyqn2DEJdw6_7lhWIxXCYFmUbArV1c/edit#gid=38800412):

###   Purpose:

The calculator outputs the optimal graduation mark of an input Current Students, Tau, and Phi values.
This calculator accounts for psi 3 upgrade marks, R9 unlocks, known fastest routes, and differences in Phi*Tau growth over different F(t) ranges.
It also outputs additional R9 boost information if R9 has been unlocked or will be unlocked on the next graduation.

###   Distribution:

This code will not work locally without the nessasary .json file. Normally the .json would have attached security risks, but due to how it is setup, these are non-existent. The code will be hosted shortly on the [Exponential Idle Discord](https://discord.gg/S9UheTC) for use. If you want usage without going through the bot you can use the [Web Version](https://replit.com/@LEBaldy2002/gradcalc).
